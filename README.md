# Portfolio-Page-Assignment-Two

This project tasked me to create a portfolio page for potential employers to view my work and learn about me.
I created a page that has some background information about me, my most recent and only assignment completed 
and my contact information. This portfolio page will be updated frequently as I complete more assignments and learn new styling techniques. 
Some styling techniques used for this assignment were box shadows, media queries, flex properties.
